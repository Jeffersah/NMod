Shipping Details:

Was digging through a box of old stuff, found something from the war. We got ambushed on the road somewhere in Ellsworth, and I got hit.

Maybe it's luck, maybe it's fate, but I got saved by a strange little penny I'd picked up a ways back. It caught the bullet, and it saved my life.

Anyway, maybe it's just sentiment, but I hope if gives you some of the same luck it gave me.

Just remember: "Heads I win, Tails you Lose"

Shipping Details:

The intern accidentally ordered way too much stuffing. Like, way, WAY too much. We've got warehouses full of the stuff. Trucks are overflowing. Employees have been taking it home with them.

Normally I'd ask if we could make a deal, you make some stuffed toys and pay us for materials, but at this point I'm just trying to get it off my hands. Turns out you don't need permission to just ship stuff to people.

Expect a lot of boxes.

Shipping Address: Acheological Center, Old Mars
Shipping Details:

We found an ancient, abandoned house on Old Earth. Looked like it was once a pretty elaborate affair, lots of boxes full of all kinds of things. Found a bunch of stuff to ship back, including this necklace.

There was a note, we're translating it as best we can. We think it says something about fighting the "Moon Lord"? Perhaps some kind of god figure, but we're not sure.

We're going to keep digging, see what else we can find.

Get this thing out of my house.

I accidentally cut myself chopping vegtables last night, and it started laughing.

I don't care where it goes.

Before the popularization of digital books, most books were made out of a flexible wood paste. These sheets of dried paste were "bound" into books primarily via the use of adhesives.
